(1)Make sure the size of image is equal to the video resolution, e.g. 1000*750

(2)Using photoshop to paint the wanted area to white and paint the unwanted area to black(now the image data is RGB value)

(3)Using matlab to  read the generated RGB mask and convert the RGB value to logical

imread('XXXX.png');
a = im2bw(rgb2gray(imread('XXXX.png')));
imwrite(a,'XXXX_.png');
